🍏 Most of the time I'm writing on Swift 

```swift
class Me: Skills {
    let frameworks = [Foundation, UIKit, SwiftUI, StoreKit, Kingfisher, ProgressHUD, SnapKit]
    let layout = [Storyboard, CodeLayout, AdaptiveLayout, SizeClasses]
    let data = [UserDefaults, Keychain, CoreData, SwiftData]
    let networking = [URlSession]
    let dependencyManagers = [CocoaPods, SPM]
    let arthitectures = [MVC, MVP, MVVM]
    let designPatterns = [Delegate, Observer, Singleton, Factory]
    let designPrinciples = [OOP, POP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID]
    let english = [B1]
}
```
